## Week 1

**Thursday, 1st October:**

_Goal:_
Create a GitHub repo to track my learning. This should help me to self-reflect more efficiently and understand my ongoing development, particularly where my strengths and weaknesses are.  

_Actions:_
- Conceptualise the way I will track my learning by creating a layout for my goals.
- Create the repo and decide on its structure.
- Write the landing page README
- Write the goals for today  

_Reflection:_
I have created the repo, it took much less time than I expected! I have made a decision on how I will structure the repo and the goals themselves, and will try to stick to this format unless I come up with an improvement. I can have a look at what other people have done in the past, particularly the GitHub examples and pick something up from there. Also, it would make sense to keep analysing the format as I am writing the goals in the future.

_Goal:_
Consolidate the knowledge on encapsulation and classes that I got from yesterday's session with Dan.  

_Actions:_
- We've done a lot yesterday and KC (pair for today) said that she's behind. This will be a good chance to go through the stuff again and see if I can do it better this time. Whenever I am able to, I will try to explain the concepts from yesterday to KC, so that we both yield a benefit from today's session.
- Start the airport challenge and try to do it properly from the start. Write the tests first and then code.  

_Reflection:_
