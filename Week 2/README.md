## Week 2

**Monday, 5th October:**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Goal:_
Learn how to give and take feedback in the context of a code review, and break a barrier of being embarassed by my code.

_Actions:_
- Make full use of the code review today and try to reflect how I could do the challenge better. 
- Attend the process workshop and try to code there.

_Reflection:_
- Me and Meryl gave each other good feedback, although we faced an issue where our code was very similar in some places and we didn't know how to comment these cases as we didn't know better. I reached out to a coach as well and was very glad to hear that my airport code looks good and that the feature test I wrote also looks good and tests for important features.
- The process workshop didn't go so well as me and my partner had a very big skill gap and he could not give me much feedback. I tried my best to evaluate what they did wrong and provide constructive feedback.

**Tuesday, 6th October:**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Goal:_
Learn some refactoring techniques and enhance my understanding of private methods.

_Actions:_
- Do the refactoring practicals

_Reflection:_
I spent my time today learning about other things. I followed a video creating an interactive card deck in Ruby and learned a lot of small things about classes and encapsulation.

**Wednesday, 7th October:**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Goal:_
Learn some refactoring techniques and enhance my understanding of private methods.

_Actions:_
- Do the refactoring practicals

_Reflection:_
I have tried to do the refactoring practicals and learned about class/method/variable extraction. Coupled with dependency injection knowledge I got yesterday, this has greatly improved my confidence working with classes, although I still sometimes struggle with class extrction when it's not obvious, like the JourneyLog example in the oystercard challenge.
Had a great pairing session with Emily yesterday where I could apply all of the above multiple times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Thursday, 8th October:**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Goal:_
Make more sense of class extraction in the oystercard challenge and try to finish it. 

_Actions:_
- Finish steps 15 and 16.

_Reflection:_
I have finished the oystercard challenge, but some of those steps did not make a lot of sense to me, for example making JourneyLog a separate class.
