## Week 2

**Monday, 5th October:**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Goal:_
Learn how to give and take feedback in the context of a code review, and break a barrier of being embarassed by my code.

_Actions:_
- Make full use of the code review today and try to reflect how I could do the challenge better. 
- Attend the process workshop and try to code there.

_Reflection:_
- Me and Meryl gave each other good feedback, although we faced an issue where our code was very similar in some places and we didn't know how to comment these cases as we didn't know better. I reached out to a coach as well and was very glad to hear that my airport code looks good and that the feature test I wrote also looks good and tests for important features.
- The process workshop didn't go so well as me and my partner had a very big skill gap and he could not give me much feedback. I tried my best to evaluate what they did wrong and provide constructive feedback.
