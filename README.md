## Hello!

This is a repository, where I track my learning via daily objectives. There is a folder for each week, where the daily objectives are listed in the respective README.

### Format

The format for the objectives that I came up with is as follows:

**Day x**
- _Goal:_ Some task that I want to finish or a concept that I aim to understand today.
- _Actions:_ What I can do to achieve my goal. I don't aim for any specific format here, but, generally, if my goal is a task, I will try to break the task down or think about what will help me finish the task in a more efficient manner. If it is a concept that I am struggling with, I will try to list the resources that will help me understand it.  
- _Reflection:_ Here I will reflect on how well have I achieved my goal for that day. I believe, that the two most important things to extract from any day/goal would be:
  1) What have I done well? If I can see that I have excelled somewhere, I would consider that particular item to be complete. From here, it is good to think about how I can expand upon what I've done well and consider it for my future goals.
  2) Where did I fail? If I have failed somewhere in particular, then this is an area that I need to define and become confident in, particularly if it is some concept.

### Backlog

This is a list of items that I would like to learn or have acknowledged incompetence in (see _Reflection_), and am yet to complete:
